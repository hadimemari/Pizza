# **App Name**: PizzaMotion

## Core Features:

- Pizza Wheel Carousel: Display pizzas in a rotating carousel with a 'spin & scale' transition when switching between menu items.
- Dynamic Pizza Card: Update the glassmorphism card with the selected pizza's name, ingredients, cheesiness rating, and pricing, fading in and out with a 200ms delay after rotation.
- Parallax Text Layers: Implement semi-transparent background text that moves slower than the pizza during carousel rotation to enhance visual depth.
- Category Navigator: Include a floating dock at the bottom with icons for different pizza categories, such as Pizza Slices, Calzones, Side Dishes/Salads, and Beverages.

## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Warm, neutral light-gray (#F9F9F9) resembling parchment to accentuate pizza crusts.
- Primary color: Muted Orange (#E67E22), referencing warm ovens and freshly baked pizza.
- Accent color: 'Italian Red' (#D32F2F) for subtle highlights on icons and call-to-action elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font providing a modern and clean feel.
- Use minimalist icons to represent ingredients in the pizza card and categories in the bottom navigator.
- Design a full-screen layout with a large pizza carousel taking center stage, a dynamic card on the right, and a bottom category navigator.
- Employ 'Spin & Scale' animations for the pizza carousel transitions, complemented by subtle parallax effects on the background text layers.
